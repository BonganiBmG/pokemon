CRUD Pokemon Application Connected To a Backend Using Express.js

This project is a web application that uses the Pokemon API to list all the Pokemon and display them on the frontend.

The backend is built with Express.js, a Node.js framework, and connects to a PostgreSQL database. 

The frontend is developed with  React. The project also uses TypeScript, and Zod, a library for parsing and validating data. The project follows the Params pattern for defining API endpoints  for validating and transforming data. The UI is styled with Chakra UI, a simple and modular component library.
